# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-23)

**Core value:** Identify and prioritize root causes of instability for reliable extended operation
**Current focus:** Phase 3 - Memory Allocation Audit

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 5 COMPLETE (Boot Profiling)
Plan: Ready to start Phase 3
Status: Phase 2 verified, proceeding to Phase 3
Last activity: 2026-01-24 — Phase 2 complete, all 4 plans executed

Progress: [######----] 60%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: 2 min
- Total execution time: 12 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-memory-instrumentation | 2 | 4min | 2min |
| 02-boot-profiling | 4 | 8min | 2min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-02 (2min), 02-01 (1min), 02-02 (2min), 02-03 (2min), 02-04 (3min)
- Trend: Consistent

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Data-driven approach - instrument first, then audit based on findings
- [Init]: Boot and memory audits run in parallel after instrumentation
- [01-01]: RNS::Instrumentation namespace for new instrumentation code
- [01-01]: Static 256-byte buffers for log formatting (avoid stack pressure)
- [01-01]: Warn at 50% fragmentation threshold, 256 bytes stack remaining
- [01-02]: Initialize memory monitor after LVGL task starts (before Reticulum)
- [01-02]: 30-second monitoring interval per CONTEXT.md
- [02-01]: Use millis() for boot timing (sufficient precision, already in codebase)
- [02-01]: First markStart() establishes boot start time (no explicit init)
- [02-01]: Wait time tracked separately from init time
- [02-02]: Wrap setup_*() calls in main setup() rather than inside each function
- [02-02]: WAIT markers inside setup_wifi() and setup_lxmf() where waits occur
- [02-03]: Disable PSRAM memory test for ~2s boot time savings
- [02-04]: Enable BOOT_REDUCED_LOGGING with CORE_DEBUG_LEVEL=2
- [02-04]: 5s target not achievable via config - reticulum init is 2.5s

### Boot Profiling Findings

**Final boot timing (with all optimizations):**
- Total: 9,704ms
- Init: 5,336ms (336ms over 5s target)
- Wait: 4,368ms (45% of boot)

**Longest phases (init time):**
1. reticulum: 2,580ms (cryptographic operations)
2. ui_manager: 957ms
3. hardware: 509ms
4. lvgl: 482ms
5. gps: 553ms (excluding 368ms GPS sync wait)

**Blocking operations identified:**
- TCP stabilization: 3,000ms fixed delay
- WiFi connect: ~1,000ms (30s timeout)
- GPS sync: ~370-950ms variable

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Resolved:**
- `PSRAMAllocator.h` - Created in src/
- `partitions.csv` - Created in examples/lxmf_tdeck/

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-24
Completed: Phase 2 (Boot Profiling)
Next: Phase 3 (Memory Allocation Audit)
