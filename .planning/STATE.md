# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-24)

**Core value:** Identify and prioritize the root causes of instability so the firmware can run reliably for extended periods without crashes or performance degradation.
**Current focus:** Phase 6 - P1 Stability Fixes

## Current Position

Phase: 6 of 6 (P1 Stability Fixes)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-01-24 — v1.1 roadmap created

Progress: [████████████████████░░░░░] 83% (15/18+ plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 15
- Average duration: ~45 min (estimated from v1.0)
- Total execution time: ~11.25 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Memory Monitoring | 3 | ~2.25h | ~45m |
| 2. Boot Profiling | 3 | ~2.25h | ~45m |
| 3. Memory Allocation Audit | 4 | ~3.0h | ~45m |
| 4. Concurrency Audit | 3 | ~2.25h | ~45m |
| 5. Synthesis | 2 | ~1.5h | ~45m |
| 6. P1 Stability Fixes | 0 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: Phase 5 synthesis work
- Trend: Stable completion velocity

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 5: WSJF scoring prioritized high-impact low-effort fixes — 5 P1 issues identified
- Phase 5: 5s boot target achieved with config-only changes — code changes deferred to future
- v1.0: Data-driven approach instrumented first, then audited — baseline established

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet. v1.1 milestone ready to plan.
